# codex-imps

Single-purpose, isolated [Codex SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openai/codex-sdk) agents — **imps** — for common CLI tools. An imp is small, fast, and bound to exactly one tool. Each imp runs with ~6K input tokens instead of the default ~22K — faster, cheaper, and focused. Interactive mode is **on by default**; explicit non-interactive runs use a warm background imp for ~2x lower latency.

All imps start with `imp-` so you can type `imp-` and tab-complete to summon the whole roster.

Where is all this headed? [VISION.md](./VISION.md) — the perfect future we're building toward and the creed every change is measured against.

## What is an imp?

An imp is a single executable TypeScript file that wraps a CLI tool with an isolated Codex agent. It:

- Loads **zero** user-space config (no plugins, skills, hooks, memories, or MCP servers)
- Replaces the ~20K system prompt with a focused, Oracle-tuned prompt optimized for small tool agents
- Disables unused tool schemas (Gmail, Slack, web, imagegen) via feature flags
- Symlinks only `auth.json` for login — token refreshes propagate automatically
- Uses `gpt-5.5` with `medium` reasoning effort by default
- Opens the interactive Codex TUI by default; `--run` streams non-interactive output when you want automation
- Clean Ctrl+C — kills the agent, its commands, and cleans up temp files immediately

An imp's meaningful behavior lives in that executable source file: base and
developer instructions, embedded context loaders, command maps, examples,
workflow rules, error recovery, and response style. Shared runtime code may
provide mechanics such as Codex isolation, launch flags, warm-server reuse,
hooks, and backend key transport, but it must not hide imp-specific behavior or
policy.

## Install

```bash
# Requires bun (https://bun.sh) and @openai/codex CLI (authenticated)
git clone https://github.com/johnlindquist/codex-imps
cd codex-imps
bun install
bun link
```

This symlinks all imps to `~/.bun/bin/`. Type `imp-` then tab to see them all. You can also run imps directly without linking:

```bash
bun imps/imp-gh
```

Local-only imps run sandboxed to match their promises: `imp-rg` is `read-only`; `imp-jq`, `imp-packx`, `imp-ffmpeg`, and `imp-imagemagick` are `workspace-write`. The sandbox enforces what the prompt claims.

## Usage

Every imp opens the interactive Codex TUI by default. Pass an initial prompt to seed the session:

```bash
# Interactive TUI in this terminal
imp-gh "list my open PRs"

# Non-interactive streaming — shows commands, output, reasoning, and todos
imp-gh --run "list my open PRs"

# Quiet non-interactive mode — buffered, only shows the final answer
imp-gh -q "list my open PRs"

# Explicit interactive flag, equivalent to the default
imp-gh -i

# Help
imp-gh --help

# Ctrl+C to stop at any time — kills agent + commands cleanly
```

### Pipe data in

Piped stdin is saved to a temp file and pointed out to the imp, so imps compose in pipelines:

```bash
cat data.json | imp-jq --run "how many users are on the pro plan?"
curl -s https://api.example.com/things | imp-jq --run "group these by status and count"
git log --oneline -30 | imp-git --run "summarize what shipped this week"
```

### Route without thinking: `imp`

`imp` picks the right imp from your prompt by deliberate keyword matching (free, instant, predictable — not a model call). When nothing matches or several imps tie, it lists candidates instead of guessing.

```bash
imp "what changed in git since yesterday?"     # -> imp-git
imp "trim the first 10s off intro.mp4"         # -> imp-ffmpeg
imp git "what changed?"                        # explicit tool prefix, no guessing
imp --which "list my PRs"                      # print the routing decision only
imp -l                                         # list all routes
```

Compound prompts route to **multiple imps, in order**. Strong connectors (`;`, `. `, `then`, `after that`) split the prompt, and when every segment routes cleanly each imp runs with only its own segment:

```bash
imp "find the TODOs in src; then commit everything"
# [1/2] imp-rg: find the TODOs in src
# [2/2] imp-git: commit everything
```

A bare `and` never splits ("open a pane and cd into it" is one cmux task), consecutive segments for the same imp merge back into one call, and if *any* segment is unclear the split is abandoned for whole-prompt routing — splitting can only ever make routing better. A failing step stops the chain. `imp --which` prints the full plan.

### Manage the fleet: `imps`

```bash
imps list                    # roster: every imp, warm status, evolution count
imps ps                      # warm imps: pid, uptime, idle timeout
imps stop imp-gh             # stop one warm imp (or: imps stop --all)
imps evolve                  # which imps have pending evolution suggestions
imps evolve imp-gh           # review one imp's pending suggestions
imp evolve imp-gh            # same review command from the user-facing router
imp-gh evolve                # open that imp's interactive evolution walkthrough
imp gh evolve                # same walkthrough via the router
imps evolve imp-gh --applied all
imps evolve imp-gh --dismiss <id>
imps doctor                  # env sanity checks + stale socket cleanup
```

Warm imps **shut themselves down after 30 idle minutes** (the next call transparently respawns one). Tune with `CODEX_IMP_IDLE_MINUTES` (`0` disables).

Typed `imps "do the thing"` when you meant `imp`? It forwards: anything that isn't a fleet command but looks like a prompt routes via the `imp` router. Near-miss subcommands (`imps lis`) still show usage instead of spending a model turn.

### Non-Interactive Warm Mode

Non-interactive runs use warm mode by default. The first `--run` call to any imp auto-starts a warm background copy of itself and routes through it; later `--run` calls reuse that same warm imp for instant responses. The warm imp holds **one persistent `codex app-server` process** alive — so process spawn, auth/config load, and the WebSocket connection + prewarm are all paid **once** on that first call, not per prompt. Each call is a fresh `thread/start` + `turn/start` on the already-warm process.

```bash
# First call auto-spawns a warm background imp, answers, and leaves it warm
imp-gh --run "list my open PRs"

# Every later call routes through the warm imp automatically — just faster
imp-gh --run "list my open issues"

# Opt OUT: force a cold in-process run (SDK exec, no warm imp)
imp-gh --no-warm "list my open PRs"

# Run the warm imp server in the foreground instead (for a supervisor like launchd/systemd)
imp-gh --serve

# Per-prompt reasoning override (warm path)
imp-gh --run --effort minimal "what's my gh auth status"

# Per-prompt warm turn timeout override (default: 5 minutes)
imp-gh --run --timeout-ms 600000 "audit this repo"
```

The auto-started warm imp is detached and persists after the call returns, so it stays warm for your next non-interactive prompt. Pass `--no-warm` whenever you want a one-off run that doesn't start or use the warm imp. Warm turn timeout defaults to 300,000 ms and can be changed per call with `--timeout-ms` / `--turn-timeout-ms`, or globally with `CODEX_IMP_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS`. Warm startup readiness defaults to 120,000 ms via `CODEX_IMP_READY_TIMEOUT_MS`; app-server RPC/start waits default to 180,000 ms via `CODEX_IMP_START_TIMEOUT_MS`.

**Edits hot-reload automatically.** A warm imp holds your imp's code in memory, so editing it would normally have no effect until you killed the process by hand. Instead, every call fingerprints the imp's source — the executable (its instructions, model, env) plus every `lib/*.ts` module it loads — and compares it to what the running warm imp was started with. If anything changed, the stale process is stopped and a fresh one is spawned **before** your prompt runs. So you can tweak an imp's internal prompt, swap the model, or change shared lib code and the **very next prompt respects the change** — no manual restart, no flag.

### Evolution suggestions

Imps no longer rewrite their own prompts from command failures. A failed command is usually a Codex/runtime/tooling issue, not proof that the imp should mutate itself.

Instead, each non-interactive invocation records a compact, redacted session log under `~/.imp/sessions/`. If the wrapper sees a bad session boundary, such as a timeout, interrupted/failed turn, or no final answer, it appends a reviewable suggestion to `~/.imp/<imp-name>.evolutions.jsonl`. Suggestions are transparent and inert until reviewed:

```bash
imps evolve                  # list imps with pending suggestions
imps evolve imp-gh           # inspect pending suggestions for one imp
imp evolve imp-gh            # same review command from the user-facing router
imp-gh evolve                # open a maintainer walkthrough for that imp
imp gh evolve                # same walkthrough via the router
imps evolve imp-gh --applied all
imps evolve imp-gh --dismiss <id>
```

To intentionally mark a turn for evolution review, prefix the prompt with
`+reason` on the first line. A bundled `UserPromptSubmit` hook saves that
feedback as review evidence and tells Codex to treat the first line as
maintainer feedback rather than task text:

```bash
imp-rg --run $'+missed the obvious parser helper\nwhere is parseArgs defined?'
```

During an interactive imp conversation, start a prompt with `^` to switch that
turn into inline imp evolution mode. Text after `^` becomes the maintainer
instruction:

```text
^ make this imp recover when gh returns rate limits
^
Handle these failures by checking status first.
```

The hook loads Imp Evolution instructions into that same turn. Those
instructions tell the imp to evolve only itself, with its own
prompt/instructions as the default and primary target: base instructions,
developer instructions, embedded context rules, command maps, workflow rules,
examples, error recovery, and response behavior. The imp must not update the
user's project files, task output, slides, app code, or unrelated repository
files. Runtime, hook, CLI, test, or documentation edits are exceptional and
should stay inside the imp-owned surface unless the issue is genuinely shared
across imps. Use `+reason` when you only want to save an evolution note for
later review. The `imp-gh evolve` walkthrough still opens a dedicated maintainer
TUI with pending suggestions, session-log paths, and the target imp source path.

Inline `^` evolution includes a `Target imp source path:` line captured from the
imp executable path at startup, so the model has a concrete file to inspect
instead of guessing which imp owns the conversation.

When an imp has pending suggestions, its next run prints a terse stderr status line before the turn starts:

```text
🔁 2 evolutions pending
```

At 3 pending suggestions the runtime writes `~/.imp/<imp-name>.evolve-request.json` and the status line changes to `evolution review ready`. That is the review trigger: it makes the review/apply step visible on the next run without silently rewriting the imp. After you make the prompt or code change, mark the reviewed suggestions with `--applied`; use `--dismiss` for noisy suggestions. The status line is deliberately stderr-only so stdout remains safe for pipes.

For automation or debugging:

```bash
imps evolve imp-gh --json       # machine-readable pending suggestions
imps evolve imp-gh --debug      # queue/status/trigger paths and env toggles
```

**`--effort <none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh>`** overrides reasoning effort for a single prompt. Lower is faster, but verified caveat: **`none` breaks tool use** — with zero reasoning the model answers trivial prompts ("say hi") but never decides to run commands, so a real `gh` task returns empty. `medium` is the default. Use `none`/`minimal` only for pure text replies.

Measured on the previous `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` low-effort default, prompt `"say hi"`, N=8 each (same session):

| Mode | Median total | Mean | Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold (SDK `codex exec` per request) | 6847 ms | 7042 ms | 4656–9901 |
| Warm (app-server imp) | 3187 ms | 3108 ms | 2095–3978 |

**~2x faster.** The first protocol frame returns in ~1 ms (the connection is hot and waiting); the remaining seconds are pure model inference on your prompt — the one cost that can't be pre-paid, since the model hasn't seen the prompt until you send it. Run-to-run variance is high (backend scheduling), so collect ≥8 samples before drawing conclusions.

Benchmark it yourself:

```bash
bun bench.ts imp-gh "say hi" --runs 8            # cold
imp-gh --serve &                                 # warm
bun bench.ts imp-gh "say hi" --runs 8 --warm
```

### What you see while streaming

```
$ gh pr list --author @me --state all --limit 3    ← command (dimmed)
#42 fix login bug  OPEN                            ← command output (dimmed)
#38 add search     MERGED                          ← command output (dimmed)
                                                   
Your 2 most recent PRs:                            ← agent's answer (normal)
1. #42 fix login bug (open)
2. #38 add search (merged)
```

Reasoning text appears in dim italic. Todo items show with ○/✓ marks. All verbose output goes to stderr, final answer to stdout — so `imp-gh --run "list PRs" > prs.txt` captures only the clean answer.

## Create your own

### Option A: Interactive generator

```bash
bun run create
# or after global install:
imp-create
```

### Option B: Copy-paste prompt

See [docs/PROMPT.md](docs/PROMPT.md) — paste it into any AI agent with your tool's `--help` output.

### Option C: Copy the template

```bash
cp imps/imp-minimal imps/imp-my-tool
chmod +x imps/imp-my-tool
# Edit and customize
```

## Prompt design

Prompts are optimized for `gpt-5.5` at `medium` reasoning effort. Key patterns:

- **Operating rule first**: "Run [tool] via exec_command before any final answer. Do not answer from memory."
- **Command maps**: Explicit IF/THEN mappings instead of vague instructions. Low-reasoning models need literal decision shortcuts.
- **Worked examples**: 3-5 few-shot examples per imp (user request → numbered exact command sequence → report step). Low-reasoning models imitate examples far better than they follow abstract rules.
- **Error recovery maps**: exact error text → exact next command, so a failed command never dead-ends the turn.
- **Consistent structure**: Every imp follows the same section order: Mission → Tool-output trust boundary → Operating rule → Command map → Workflow → Mutation policy → Worked examples → Error recovery → Command rules → Output.
- **No --help dumps**: Curated command maps are more effective than raw CLI reference for focused tool agents.

## How isolation works

Each imp creates a temporary `CODEX_HOME` with only a symlinked `auth.json`. Combined with feature flags, this strips ~16K tokens of overhead:

| What's disabled | Tokens saved | Config key |
|---|---|---|
| Server-side apps (Gmail, Slack, DeepWiki) | ~14,000 | `features.apps = false` |
| Image generation | ~1,000 | `features.image_generation = false` |
| Web search | ~1,000 | `web_search = "disabled"` |
| Tool discovery | ~500 | `features.tool_search = false` |
| Model/base instructions | ~5,000 | CLI/TOML: `instructions` or `model_instructions_file`; SDK typed config: `base_instructions` |
| Skills, plugins, hooks, memories | varies | Feature flags |

See [docs/ISOLATION.md](docs/ISOLATION.md) for the full research with source line references.

## Evals (model-paid behavioral checks)

`bun test` proves the imps *load*; evals prove they *behave*. Each suite in `evals/` runs real prompts against a hermetic temp-dir fixture and asserts on the answer **and** the resulting filesystem (e.g. imp-jq must create `users.csv` and must NOT touch `users.json`; imp-git must commit only the named file and leave unrelated dirty files alone). One model turn per case — run after editing an imp's prompt; hot-reload means the very next eval exercises the change.

```bash
bun run evals               # all suites
bun evals.ts imp-jq         # one suite
bun evals.ts imp-git --filter commit --keep   # one case, keep sandbox for post-mortem
```

## Tests

Fast, model-free smoke tests guard against arg-parsing and load regressions:

```bash
bun test
```

`test/parseargs.test.ts` exhaustively checks flag/prompt parsing (the spot a past `--effort` bug dropped the first prompt word). `test/cli-smoke.test.ts` loads every imp binary, checks `--help`/no-args, and confirms a real prompt survives parsing without paying a model turn.

**Push gate:** enable the pre-push hook once per clone so failing tests block a push:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

(Override an individual push with `git push --no-verify`.)

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0+
- [Codex CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openai/codex) (authenticated — `codex auth login`)
- The CLI tool each imp wraps (e.g. `gh`, `bird`, `cmux`)
